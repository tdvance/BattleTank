# BattleTank
An open-world head-to-head tank fight with simple AI, terrain, and advanced control system in Unreal 4

##Introduction

Battle Tank is a head-to-head third-person 3D strategy game in which two tanks, one controlled by a player, the other by either a second player or an AI, face off on a terrain and use the terrain tactically to their advantage.  Each tank attempts to get in firing range of the other and fire a mortar at the other tank, while simultaneously avoiding mortars from the other tank.  References include Tank World and the Goliath Tank vehicle in Unreal Tournament 3.

###Game Atmosphere

Insert sketches here.

Terrain is mostly-flat battlefield area surrounded by impassable mountains.  Hills in the battlefield provide strategic/tactical opportunities.

Tanks are meant to be somewhat realistic (not super art/photorealistic, as this is not a commercial game by a tripple-A studio).

Audio includes background music, sounds for firing and tank engines and collisions/damage/explosions.  Mostly using open source.

###Game Play

Use mouse/keyboard or game controller to move tank and look around, to search for the opponent tank.    Stay close to hills to hide behind if opponent fires upon you.  If you see opponent, quickly aim and fire and then go to cover.  Continue until you destroy your opponent or your opponent destroys you.


###Key Features

Single level, play till one person dies.
One opponent, either another player or AI.
Replay to accumulate kills/deaths.
